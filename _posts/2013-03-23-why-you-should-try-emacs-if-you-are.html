<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Are you a GNU Bash user but you are not using Emacs? Perhaps you should consider trying it. You will be amazed by the similarities...<br /><br />I know, your IDE (Eclipse, QT, etc.) is superior and you are extremely productive with it. Why bother using an ancient editor like Emacs? I will not begin another flamewar by comparing popular IDEs with Emacs. Choose whatever you prefer during programming. But if you want to be productive while using a UNIX-like system, Emacs (and of course Vim but I can't speak for Vim since I'm an Emacs user) can really help you.<br /><br />The truth is that if you are already productive in Bash (mandatory reading: <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2009/09/bash-shortcuts-for-maximum-productivity/">Bash Shortcuts For Maximum Productivity</a>) you are familiar with Emacs but you don't know it yet :) The default key bindings of Bash are also used by Emacs. Let me show you some examples (my apologies to screencast haters but that's the best way of demonstrating keyboard typing):<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/SPSoT22fwzM/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/SPSoT22fwzM?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/SPSoT22fwzM?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />So, what does this screencast demonstrate? My goal is to use the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">find</span> command for searching all files with the suffix <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">.conf</span> that live under the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/etc</span> directory. First fix: I mistyped <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">.cofn</span> instead of <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">.conf</span> and used the transpose character function <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">(C-t)</span>* to correct the mistake. Second fix: I forgot that <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">find</span> expects the searching path as its first argument and incorrectly provided it as the second. To fix that I first used <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">C-p</span> to access the most recent command in the command history (this functionality is not offered by Emacs as such). I then used the kill function <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">(C-w)</span> to "cut" backwards one word, <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">C-a</span> to go to the beginning of the line, <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">M-f</span> to go one word forward, and the yank function <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">(C-y)</span> to "paste" the most recently killed word (that is, the search path) at the expected place.<br /><br />The moral of the story: When you learn about a new shortcut in Emacs, try it also in Bash. There's a great chance that its behavior will be very similar (if not exactly the same).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">* In case you are not familiar with the Emacs terminology: <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">C</span> typically means the Ctrl keyboard button, and <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">M</span> means the Alt keyboard button. As an example<span style="font-size: x-small;"> <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">M-f</span> means</span> pressing first Alt followed by <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">f</span> (move the prompt one word forward).</span></div>
