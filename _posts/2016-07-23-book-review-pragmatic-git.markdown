The title of this book describes it correctly. It is a compact guide
covering the basic (and a few more advanced) use cases of Git. If you
have already used Git you most likely know everything (or almost
everything) explained in this book. That was my case, but I've also
learnt a few new commands and concepts (like why it's useful to use
`--` before providing any file/path names to avoid clashing).

Do not expect an in depth explanation of how Git works under the hood.
It is not the focus of this book and there is at least [one free book][pro-git]
that does this well. But since I find the documentation of Git (yes, I'm talking
about you man pages) chaotic it is still useful for me to have a book which is
task-oriented and I can always refer to if I forget a specific Git command or
concept.
