<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is a very interesting programming language. If you haven't checked it yet, go ahead. Apart from being a pragmatic Lisp that offers easy Java interop, it also has a nice community. So far I haven't spent as much time on the language as I would like, but I'm planning to do that.<br /><br />I was planning to write a few comments about each talk of the first (ever) <a href="http://clojuredays.org/">Dutch Clojure Days</a> event, but I just noticed that the whole conference is now available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjzcwcP9P2LeiVXofnnXcxAqvmVNn3fTD">online</a>.<br /><br />If you don't want to watch every keynote, there's one that intrigued me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at6Q8sNx95A&amp;list=PLjzcwcP9P2LeiVXofnnXcxAqvmVNn3fTD&amp;index=3">Conversational Computing:  How Okasaki made McCarthy right yet again</a>. I liked the way Michiel is trying to connect the dots.<br /><br />And if you liked my recommendation and want a second one, try <span class="watch-title" dir="ltr" id="eow-title" title="Clojure for Data Science  the good, the bad, and the ugly by Simon Belak"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ_3phggAJ8&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLjzcwcP9P2LeiVXofnnXcxAqvmVNn3fTD">Clojure for Data Science:  the good, the bad, and the ugly</a>. Simon covers many nice concepts of functional programming, without being afraid to criticize the ugly parts and express his ideas on how things can be improved.</span><br /><span class="watch-title" dir="ltr" id="eow-title" title="Clojure for Data Science  the good, the bad, and the ugly by Simon Belak"><br /></span><span class="watch-title" dir="ltr" id="eow-title" title="Clojure for Data Science  the good, the bad, and the ugly by Simon Belak">I'm very glad that I attended this conference. It was free (gratis) but thanks to the kind sponsors we had everything (coffee, muffins, and sandwiches). The venue was nice, and the location great (well, I love Amsterdam anyway). So yeah, nice work guys and until next year happy Lisping in Clojure ;)</span></div>
