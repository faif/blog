<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">During the last month(s) I participated in the review process of a book about Design Patterns in Python. I am happy to see that the book has been released. The title of it is <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-python-design-patterns/book">Learning Python Design Patterns</a>.<br /><br />Reviewing a book is definitely not harder than writing one, but that doesn't mean that it's not challenging. The comments must be clear in context, useful, and not offensive. The process requires a considerable amount of time since all comments/remarks/notes must be backed by research and reliable references.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed the whole procedure which thanks to the people of packt publishing (packtpub) was flexible and clear. Plus, I'll receive a free hard-copy of the book that I reviewed and a copy of my favourite packtpub ebook. Not bad!<br /><br />In the future I hope that I'll have the chance (and the time) to write my own book about a topic that I like.</div>
