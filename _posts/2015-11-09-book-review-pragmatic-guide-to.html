The author  gives good advice regarding which features of pure JavaScript are fine  to use and for which features a framework should be preferred to avoid  browser incompatibilities.<br /><br /> Many popular applications are demonstrated (custom tooltips, infinite  scrolling, form validation, autocompletion, lightbox, 3rd party APIs)  and concepts such as client vs server programming are clearly explained.  Christophe's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Guide-JavaScript-Programmers/product-reviews/1934356670/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=byRankDescending">focus on Prototype</a> is not a problem for me. It's his  favorite framework and the one that he knows well, so it make sense that  he's using it for the demos.<br /><br />One practical problem: this book is not maintained any more, and as a consequence a few examples are broken, due to a domain that has expired and changes to the Twitter API. I contacted the author on <a href="https://github.com/tdd/pragmatic-javascript/issues/2">GitHub </a>and he confirmed it. But still, for a book that was published five years ago it's a nice compact guide to people who are familiar with programming and want to focus on the specifics of JavaScript.<br />              </div></div>
