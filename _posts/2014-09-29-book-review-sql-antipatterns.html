<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="description markdown collapsible">                In <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/bksqla/sql-antipatterns">SQL Antipatterns</a>, Bill Karwin does a great job in explaining how to  make efficient use of the relational model, instead of abusing it like  it's usually done. Many developers abuse relational databases using  antipatterns such as ID required, entity-attribute-value, index  overkill, and so forth (you should read this book without second  thought). Some developers go as far as trying to implement a search  engine based on the <code>LIKE</code> keyword.<br /><br /> All those are examples of not using the relational model properly. If  we want to bypass referential integrity or save everything in one  table, then we should not use a relational DB in the first place.  Cursing on the performance of a relational DB when it's not properly  used is very wrong.<br />              </div></div>
